## 🎓 How to Use This Plan

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Read the day's file completely** before starting
2. **Follow each section in order** - they build on each other
3. **Type the code yourself** - don't just copy-paste
4. **Test after each section** - verify things work
5. **Use the troubleshooting guide** if stuck

### Tips for Success:

- 💡 Take breaks every 2 hours
- 💡 Keep notes of things you don't understand
- 💡 Google concepts you're unfamiliar with
- 💡 Use the cheatsheet for quick reference
- 💡 Don't skip steps - each one matters
